1.User Request:

A user wants to access the website by entering www.foobar.com in their browser.


2.Domain Name:

The domain name foobar.com is configured with a www record that points to the server's IP address 8.8.8.8.


3.Server:

A server is a physical or virtual machine that hosts the web infrastructure components.
The server has the IP address 8.8.8.8.


4.Web Server (Nginx):

The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests from users.
It serves static content (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.


5.Application Server:

The application server runs the application code and processes dynamic requests.
It communicates with the database to fetch or store data as needed.


6.Application Files:

The application files contain the codebase for the website.


7.Database (MySQL):

The database stores and manages data for the website.
MySQL is used as the database management system.

9.Communication:

The server uses HTTP/HTTPS protocols to communicate with the user's computer.
Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.
Downtime During Maintenance: Deploying new code or restarting the web server causes downtime.
Scalability: The infrastructure cannot handle a large amount of incoming traffic, leading to potential performance issues.
